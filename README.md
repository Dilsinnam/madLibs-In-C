  <p align="center">
    My first C "project" that is fully made in C. I wanted to get familiar with using GitHub, so this readme was created to get used to it when I focus and learn more on other projects.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://i.imgur.com/byMZDhC.png)

If you don't know what MadLibs is, imagine a "fill in the blank" style game where you, the user, generates the story. You essentially have a preset story with blank words that you choose. These words are verbs or nouns that get filled into the story with what you chose. For example, you could say "My dog is green". Playing the MadLibs game, you could end up saying "My dog is a computer".

I choose a soccer story for this one because of my love for the game (GO UNITED!).
